# ZK Battleship

## QuickStart

### Build Guide

To compile this Aleo program, run:
```bash
aleo build
```

### Usage Guide
<details><summary>Commands and Playing the Game</summary>

In order to play battleship, there must be two players with two boards. Navigate to the zk-battleship aleo project. Then create two new aleo accounts:
```bash
aleo account new
>>>  Private Key  APrivateKey1zkpGKaJY47BXb6knSqmT3JZnBUEGBDFAWz2nMVSsjwYpJmm
>>>     View Key  AViewKey1fSyEPXxfPFVgjL6qcM9izWRGrhSHKXyN3c64BNsAjnA6
>>>      Address  aleo15g9c69urtdhvfml0vjl8px07txmxsy454urhgzk57szmcuttpqgq5cvcdy

aleo account new
>>>  Private Key  APrivateKey1zkp86FNGdKxjgAdgQZ967bqBanjuHkAaoRe19RK24ZCGsHH
>>>     View Key  AViewKey1hh6dvSEgeMdfseP4hfdbNYjX4grETwCuTbKnCftkpMwE
>>>      Address  aleo1wyvu96dvv0auq9e4qme54kjuhzglyfcf576h0g3nrrmrmr0505pqd6wnry
```

Save the keys and addresses. Set the `program.json` private_key and address to one of the newly created aleo accounts. We'll refer to this address as Player 1, and the remaining address as Player 2.

```json
{
    "program": "battleship.aleo",
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "description": "Play ZK Battleship",
    "development": {

    },
    "license": "MIT"
}
```

Now, we need to make a board as Player 1. See the [modeling the boards and ships](https://github.com/demox-labs/zk-battleship/#modeling-the-board-and-ships) section for information on valid ship bitstrings and placements on the board. For this example, we will be using sample valid inputs. Initialize a new board as Player 1 with valid ship inputs and Player 2's address: `aleo run initialize_board ship_5_bitstring ship_4_bitstring ship_3_bitstring ship_2_bitstring player_2_address`
```bash
aleo run initialize_board 34084860461056u64 551911718912u64 7u64 1157425104234217472u64 aleo1wyvu96dvv0auq9e4qme54kjuhzglyfcf576h0g3nrrmrmr0505pqd6wnry

The output is a board_state record owned by Player 1. Notice that the `game_started` flag is false, as well as the composite ship configuration `ships`. 1157459741006397447u64 to a binary bitstring becomes `0001000000010000000111111000000010000000100000001000000000000111`, or laid out in columns and rows:

Now, we can offer a battleship game to player 2. Run `aleo run offer_battleship 'board_state.record'` with the record you just created:
```bash

✅ Executed 'battleship.aleo/offer_battleship'
```

The first output record is the udpated board_state.record. Notice the `game_started` flag is now true. This board cannot be used to offer any other battleship games or accept any battleship game offers. Player 1 would need to initialize a new board and use that instead. The second output record is a dummy move.record -- there are no fire coordinates included to play on Player 2's board, and no information about any previous Player 2 moves (Player 2 has not made any moves yet). This move.record is owned by Player 2, who must use that in combination with their own board_state.record to accept the game. Let's do that now.

We must run the program as Player 2 now, so switch the `program.json` file to use Player 2's keys:
```json
{
    "program": "battleship.aleo",
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "description": "Play ZK Battleship",
    "development": {
        "private_key": "APrivateKey1zkp86FNGdKxjgAdgQZ967bqBanjuHkAaoRe19RK24ZCGsHH",

    },
    "license": "MIT"
}
```

We'll create a new and different board for Player 2, and make sure to include Player 1's address as the opponent:
```bash
aleo run initialize_board 31u64 2207646875648u64 224u64 9042383626829824u64 aleo15g9c69urtdhvfml0vjl8px07txmxsy454urhgzk57szmcuttpqgq5cvcdy

Note, the output ships here is 9044591273705727u64, which in a bitstring is:

Now, we can accept Player 1's offer. Run `aleo run start_battleship 'board_state.record' 'move.record'`:
```bash

Notice the outputs here are similar to `offer_battleship`. A dummy move.record is owned by Player 1, and Player 2 gets a board_state.record with the `game_started` flag updated. However, now that Player 1 has a move.record and a started board, they can begin to play. Switch `program.json`'s keys back to Player 1's. Player 1 now makes the first real move: `aleo run play 'board_state.record' 'move.record' fire_coordinate`

Player 1 has an updated board_state.record -- they have a new `played_tiles` bitstring, which corresponds to the fire coordinate they just sent to Player 2. You can see that the `incoming_fire_coordinate` in the move.record owned by Player 2 matches exactly the input given by Player 1. Player 2 can now play this move tile and respond with a fire coordinate of their own, and they will also let Player 1 know whether or not Player 1's fire coordinate hit or miss Player 2's ships.

Switch `program.json` to Player 2's keys. Player 2 makes their move:

Player 2 now has an updated board_state.record which includes their newly updated `played_tiles`, only containing the fire coordinate they just sent to Player 1. Player 1 now owns a new move.record which includes the `hits_and_misses` field. This contains only the result of Player 1's previous fire coordinate they had sent to Player 2. It will always be a single coordinate on the 8x8 grid if it's a hit. A miss is 0u64 (8x8 grid of 0s), whereas a hit is the u64 equivalent of their previous fire coordinate in bitstring form. If you check Player 2's ships configuration, you'll note their entire bottom row is covered by two ships, so sample valid hits on the bottom row would be: 1u64, 2u64, 4u64, 8u64, 16u64, 32u64, 64u64, and 128u64. Since Player 1's first fire coordinate (1u64) was a hit, the `hits_and_misses` field is also 1u64.

Player 1's next move will consume this move.record, which will update Player 1's board with the hit-or-miss, as well as figure out the result of Player 2's fire coordinate. Now that Player 1 has some `played_tiles`, they can no longer choose an alread-played fire coordinate. For example, running `aleo run play 'board_state.record' 'move.record' 1u64` will fail, because 1u64 has already been played.

Switch `program.json` to use Player 1's keys. Run:

## Strategy for Creating ZK Battleship

Battleship is a game where two players lay their ships into secret configurations on their respective 8x8 grids, and then take turns firing upon each other's board. The game ends when one player has sunk all of the other player's ships.

How can we ensure that the ship configurations of each player remains secret, while being able to trustlessly and fairly play with their opponent? ZK proofs on the Aleo chain can help us lay out rigid rules that must be followed in order to prevent cheating.

Broadly speaking, we can follow this general strategy:
1. Create mathematical rules for placing the ships on the board, to ensure that neither player can cheat by stacking all their ships in one place, moving them off the board, or laying them across each other.

2. Ensure that the players and boards that begin a game cannot be swapped out.

3. Ensure that each player can only move once before the next player can move.

4. Enforce constraints on valid moves, and force the player to give their opponent information about their opponent's previous move in order to continue playing.

See the github repo in order to follow along.

## Modeling the board and ships

Most battleship representations in programs use a 64 character string or an array of arrays (8 arrays of 8 elements each) to model the board state. Unfortunately, Aleo instructions don't represent strings well yet, nor can we use for or while loops. Luckily for us, Aleo has the unsigned 64 bit integer type, or u64. To represent every space on a battleship board, from top left to bottom right, we can use each bit in a u64. For example, an empty board would be:
0u64 =
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Battleship is played with 4 different ship types -- a ship of length 5, length 4, length 3, and length 2. Some versions of battleship have an extra length 3 ship or another extra ship type, however, we will stick to the most basic version for this project. In order to be a valid ship placement, a ship must be placed vertically or horizontally (no diagonals). On a physical board, a ship cannot break across rows or intersect with another ship, but ships are allowed to touch one another.

Similar to how we represent a board with a u64 bitstring, we can represent a ship horizontally as a bitstring. We "flip" the bits to represent a ship:
| Length | Bitstring | u64 |
| ------ | --------- | --- |
| 5 | 11111 | 31u64|
| 4 | 1111  | 15u64|
| 3 | 111   | 7u64 |
| 2 | 11    | 3u64 |

We can also represent a ship vertically as a bitstring. To show this, we need 7 "unflipped" bits (zeroes) in between the flipped bits so that the bits are adjacent vertically.
| Length | Bitstring | u64 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | 1 00000001 00000001 00000001 00000001 | 4311810305u64 |
| 4 | 1 00000001 00000001 00000001          | 16843009u64 |
| 3 | 1 00000001 00000001                   | 65793u64 |
| 2 | 1 00000001                            | 257u64 |

With a board model and ship bitstring models, we can now place ships on a board.

Given these rules, our strategy will be to validate each individaul ship bitstring placement on a board, and then, if all the ships are valid, compose all the positions onto a board and validate that the board with all ships are valid. If each individual ship's position is valid, then all the ships together should be valid unless any overlapping occurs.

## Validating a single ship at a time

To follow along with the code, all verification of ship bitstrings is done in verify.aleo. We know a ship is valid if all these conditions are met:
If horizontal:
1. The correct number of bits is flipped (a ship of length 5 should not have 6 flipped bits)
2. All the bits are adjacent to each other.
3. The bits do not split a row.

If vertical:
1. The correct number of bits is flipped.
2. All the bits are adjacent to each other, vertically. This means that each flipped bit should be separated by exactly 7 unflipped bits.
3. The bits do not split a column.

If a ship is valid vertically or horizontally, then we know the ship is valid. We just need to check for the bit count, the adjacency of those bits, and make sure those bits do not split a row/column. However, we can't loop through the bit string to count bits, or to make sure those bits don't break across columns. We'll need to turn to special bitwise operations and hacks.

<details><summary>Bit Counting</summary>

See the "c_bitcount" closure to follow along with the code. 50 years ago, MIT AI Laboratory published HAKMEM, which was a series of tricks and hacks to speed up processing for bitwise operations. https://w3.pppl.gov/~hammett/work/2009/AIM-239-ocr.pdf We turned to HAKMEM 169 for bitcounting inspiration, although we've tweaked our implementation to be (hopefully) easier to understand. Before diving into details, let's build some intuition.

Let a,b,c,d be either 0 or 1. Given a polynomial 8a + 4b + 2c + d, how do we find the summation of a + b + c + d?
If we subtract subsets of this polynomial, we'll be left with the summation.  
Step 1:  8a + 4b + 2c + d  
Step 2: -4a - 2b -  c  
Step 3: -2a -  b  
Step 4: - a  
Step 5: = a +  b +  c + d  
This polynomial is basically a bitwise representation of a number, so given a 4 bit number, e.g. 1011 or 13u64, we can follow these instructions to get the bit count. Step 2 is just subtracting the starting number but bit shifted to the right (equivalent to dividing by 2). Step 3 bit shifts the starting number to the right twice and is subtracted, and Step 4 bit shifts thrice and is subtracted. Put another way: Start with a 4-digit binary number A. A - (A >> 1) - (A >> 2) - (A >> 3) = B.  
Step 1:  1101 = 13u64  
Step 2: -0110 =  6u64  
Step 3: -0011 =  3u64  
Step 4: -0001 =  1u64  
Step 5: =0011 =  3u64  

To make this process work for any bit-length number, where the sum of the bits is left in groups of 4 bits, we'll need to use some bit-masking, so that the sum of one group of 4 does not interfere with the next group of 4.
With a larger starting number, like 1111 0001 0111 0110, we will need the following bit maskings:
```
For A >> 1, we'll use 0111 0111 0111 .... (in u64, this is 8608480567731124087u64)
For A >> 2, we'll use 0011 0011 0011 .... (in u64, this is 3689348814741910323u64)
For A >> 3, we'll use 0001 0001 0001 .... (in u64, this is 1229782938247303441u64)
```

For example, finding the sums of groups of 4 with a 16-bit number we'll call A to yield the bit sum number B:
```
A:    1111 0001 0111 0110  
A>>1: 0111 1000 1011 1011  
A>>2: 0011 1100 0101 1101  
A>>3: 0001 1110 0010 1110  

A>>1: 0111 1000 1011 1011  
    & 0111 0111 0111 0111:  
      0111 0000 0011 0011  

A>>2: 0011 1100 0101 1101  
    & 0011 0011 0011 0011:  
      0011 0000 0001 0001  

A>>3: 0001 1110 0010 1110  
    & 0001 0001 0001 0001:  
      0001 0000 0000 0000  

A - (A>>1 & 0111....) - (A>>2 & 0011....) - (A>>3 & 0001....):
B:    0100 0001 0011 0010  
      4    1    3    2
```

The next step is to combine the summation of each of those 4-bit groups into sums of 8-bit groups. To do this, we'll use another bit trick. We will shift this number B to the right by 4 (B >> 4), and add that back to B. Then, we'll apply a bit masking of 0000 1111 0000 1111 .... (in u64, this is 1085102592571150095u64) to yield the sums of bits in groups of 8, a number we'll call C.
```
B:    0100 0001 0011 0010  
B>>4: 0000 0100 0001 0011  
      0100 0101 0100 0101  
      4    5    4    5

apply the bit mask  
      0000 1111 0000 1111  

C:    0000 0101 0000 0101  
      0    5    0    5
```

At this point, we've gone from a bit sum in groups of 4 to bit sums in groups of 8. That's great, but ultimately we want the total sum of bits in the original binary number. The final bit trick is to modulo C by 255. This is 2^8 - 1. For a bit of intuition, consider the number 1 0000 0001. If we take 1 0000 0001 mod 256, we're left with 1. If we take 1 0000 0001 mod 255, we're left with 2. Modding by 255 gives us the amount of bits _beyond_ the first 255 numbers, as 255 is the largest number that can be represented with 8 bits.

A full summary of abbreviated steps to get the bit count, starting with a 64 bit integer A (closely following the c_bitcount closure in the verify.aleo code):
let A = 64 unsigned bit integer
let B = A - (A>>1 & 8608480567731124087u64) - (A>>2 & 3689348814741910323u64) - (A>>3 & 1229782938247303441u64)
let C = (B - B>>4) & 1085102592571150095u64
bit count = C mod 255u64

Given a ship's placement on the board and its bitstring representation (horizontally or vertically), we can determine if the bits are adjacent. Follow the c_adjacency_check closure in verify.aleo. Given the ship of length 2, we know it's horizontal bitstring is 11 (3u64) and it's vertical bitstring is 100000001 (257u64). If on the board, the ship starts at the bottom right corner, its horizontal ship placement string would be:  
3u64

We can make the observation that the original bitstring is always shifted by a power of 2 to get to a new valid position on the board. Therefore, if we take the ship placement bitstring and divide by the ship bitstring (either horizontal or vertical), as long as the remaining number is a power of 2 (2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3...), we know the ship's bits are adjacent.

To ensure that the remaining number is a power of 2, we can use a bit trick. See the bit trick for ensuring a bitstring is a power of 2 section.

In the code, you'll notice one extra step. Dividing a ship placement bitstring by a ship bitstring representation could result in 0, and then subtracting by 1 will result in an underflow. In that case, we know the ship placement is not valid, so we can set a number which is gauranteed to not be a power of 2.

<details><summary>Splitting a row or column</summary>
Follow the c_horizontal_check closure in verify.aleo to follow the code. Assume all the bits are adjacent (see the adjacency check section). The column case is trivial. We can be certain that if a ship bitstring splits columns, the division of that ship placement bitstring by its ship bitstring representation will not yield a power of 2, and it would have failed the adjacency check.

The horizontal case must be checked because a split row bitstring could still contain a ship with adjacent bits. To make this check easier, we will condense the 64 bitstring into an 8 bitstring by taking it modulo 255. If we assume that a bitstring is not splitting a row, then taking the ship placement bitstring modulo 255 will yield an 8 bit valid bitstring. If the original ship placement bitstring is not valid, then we will have an invalid 8 bit bitstring. E.g.:  
```
1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
```
mod 255 = 11100000 (valid)

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1  
1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
```
mod 255 = 11000001 (invalid)

How do we know the 8 bit bitstring is valid or not? We can simply do an adjacency check, as before.

<details><summary>Ensuring a bitstring is a power of 2</summary>

Any power of 2 will have a single bit flipped. If we subtract 1 from that number, it will result in a complementary bitstring that, bitwise-anded with the original, will always result in 0.

E.g.
```
8:   1000
8-1: 0111
8&7: 0000 == 0

7:   0111
7-1: 0110
7&6: 0110 != 0
```

## Validating all ships together in a single board

Give individual valid ship position bitstrings, we can combine all these together into a single board using bitwise or operators. See the create_board function in verify.aleo to follow the code. Once all ships are on the board, we can count the total number of bits, which should be 14 exactly for a ship of length 5, 4, 3, and 2.

## Ensure that players and boards cannot swap mid-game

Board states are represented with the board_state record. Each board has a flag indicating whether a game has been started with the board. This flag is set when offering a battleship game to an opponent, or accepting a battleship game from an opponent. Move records are created only in 3 ways:
1. Offering a battleship game creates a dummy move record that sets the two players to the addresses set in the board state record.
2. Accepting a battleship game consumes the first dummy move record and checks that the move record contains the same two players as the board of the player accepting the game. Then, a new dummy move record is created and keeps the same two players.
2. A move record must be consumed in order to play and create the next move record. There's a check to ensure the players in the move record matches the players in the board, and the players in the next move record are automatically set.

The only way moves _not_ matching a board can be combined is if the players begin multiple games with each other. As long as one player is honest and only accepts a single game with a particular opponent, only one set of moves can be played on one board between them.

## Ensure that each player can only move once before the next player can move

A move record must be consumed in order to create the next move record. The owner of the move record changes with each play. Player A must spend a move record in order to create a move record containing their fire coordinate, and that move record will be owned by Player B. Player B must spend that move record in order to create the next move record, which will belong to Player A.

## Enforce constraints on valid moves, and force the player to give their opponent information about their opponent's previous move in order to continue playing

A valid move for a player is a fire coordinate that has only one flipped bit in a u64. We can make sure only one bit is flipped with the powers of 2 bit trick. That single bit must be a coordinate that has not been played by that player before, which we check in board.aleo/update_played_tiles.

In order to give their next move to their opponent, a player must call the main.aleo/play function, which checks the opponent's fire coordinate on the current player's board. The move record being created is updated with whether that fire coordinate was a hit or a miss for the opponent.

## Winning the game

Right now, the way to check when a game has been won is to count the number of hits on your hits_and_misses field on your board_state record. Once you have 14 hits, you've won the game.
